cbrowse
=======

Trying to learn by writing a code browser like cscope. I hate it when cscope.out is too large and there are space issues. So, trying to reduce the size occupied by the db.

TODO/Experiments:
 1. Reduce symbol size using a simple compression algo for strings and store it in the trie.
 2. Try trie compression and other algos. :)
